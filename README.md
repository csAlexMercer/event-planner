**Project Description**

This is a web application designed to allow users to create, manage, and RSVP to events. The project demonstrates proficiency in event-based data management, user interactions, and role-based access control.

The application supports two distinct roles:

    Admins: Can create and modify event details and monitor attendance.
    Users: Can view available events and respond with their attendance status.

**Technologies Used**

Frontend: React.js 

Backend & Database: Firebase (Firestore Database)

Authentication: Firebase Authentication

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

Why these technologies were chosen:

    React.js: Selected for its component-based architecture, making the UI modular and easy to manage.
    Firebase: Chosen for its seamless integration of real-time database capabilities (Firestore), secure authentication handling, and serverless infrastructure, allowing for rapid development of the required features. Best for small applications
